# Step 2: Canvas App Development - Complete

**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**App Name**: AYH Service Request Hub

## App Architecture

### Multi-Role Interface Design
Built single canvas app with 4 role-based screens:
- **StaffScreen**: Request submission and tracking
- **DepartmentScreen**: Work queue management
- **DirectorScreen**: Approval dashboard for high-cost requests
- **AdminScreen**: System overview and KPIs

### Automatic Role Detection
Implemented OnStart logic to detect user role and navigate to appropriate screen:
```javascript
Set(varUserEmail, Lower(User().Email));
Set(varUserDepartment, LookUp(Departments, Lower(Manager.Email) = varUserEmail));

// Role hierarchy detection
Set(varIsManager, !IsBlank(varUserDepartment));
Set(varIsDirector, varUserEmail = "director@yourhospital.com");
Set(varIsAdmin, varUserEmail = "admin@yourhospital.com");

// Navigate to highest privilege screen
Navigate(If(varIsAdmin, AdminScreen, varIsDirector, DirectorScreen, ...))
```

## Screen Implementations

### 1. StaffScreen - Request Submission ✅
**Purpose**: Simple form for hospital staff to submit service requests

**Key Features**:
- Request title and description fields
- Category, priority, and department dropdowns
- **Estimated cost field** (triggers director approval)
- **Business justification field** (visible when cost > $5,000)
- **Auto-flagging logic** for director approval requirements
- "My Requests" gallery showing user's submissions

**Director Approval Integration**:
```javascript
// Auto-flag expensive/critical requests
'Requires Director Approval':
    Value(txtCost.Text) > 5000 ||
    drpPriority.Selected.Value = "Critical" ||
    drpCategory.Selected.Value in ["Clinical Support", "Maintenance"]

// Set appropriate initial status
Status: If(flagged_for_approval, "Pending Director Approval", "New")
```

### 2. DepartmentScreen - Work Queue Management ✅
**Purpose**: Department agents and managers handle assigned requests

**Key Features**:
- **Toggle filters**: Unassigned, My Queue, All requests
- **Smart filtering**: Excludes director approval pending requests
- **Assignment actions**: "Assign to Me" button
- **Status updates**: Mark as resolved, add comments
- **Department scope**: Only shows requests for user's department

**Queue Filter Logic**:
```javascript
Filter(Requests,
    'Owning Department'.Id = varUserDepartment.Id &&
    Status.Value <> "Pending Director Approval" &&  // Agents can't work on these
    (toggle_based_filters)
)
```

### 3. DirectorScreen - Approval Dashboard ✅
**Purpose**: Hospital Operations Director approves/rejects high-cost requests

**Key Features**:
- **Pending approvals gallery**: Shows only requests requiring director approval
- **Request details display**: Cost, justification, department, priority
- **Three action buttons**: Approve, Reject, Need More Info
- **Comments system**: Director can add approval/rejection reasons
- **Status tracking**: Updates approval status and main request status

**Approval Actions**:
- **Approve**: Sets status to "Director Approved", records approver and date
- **Reject**: Sets status to "Director Rejected", closes request
- **Need Info**: Keeps pending, adds comment requesting clarification

### 4. AdminScreen - System Overview ✅
**Purpose**: System administrators view metrics and manage system

**Key Features**:
- **KPI cards**: Open requests, pending approvals, high priority count
- **Financial metrics**: Total cost of pending approvals
- **Recent activity**: Last 7 days of request submissions
- **System health indicators**: Overall performance metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Data Connections
- ✅ Connected to all 6 Dataverse tables
- ✅ Office 365 Users connection for user lookups
- ✅ Proper relationship navigation (Department.Manager, Request.'Assigned To', etc.)

### Key Formulas Implemented

**Request Submission with Director Approval**:
```javascript
Patch(Requests, Defaults(Requests), {
    'Request Title': txtTitle.Text,
    Description: txtDescription.Text,
    Category: drpCategory.Selected,
    Priority: drpPriority.Selected,
    'Estimated Cost': Value(txtCost.Text),
    'Requires Director Approval': auto_flag_logic,
    Status: conditional_status_based_on_approval_need
});
```

**Department Queue with Smart Filtering**:
```javascript
Filter(Requests,
    department_scope &&
    not_pending_director_approval &&
    toggle_based_visibility
)
```

**Director Approval Process**:
```javascript
// Approve
Patch(ThisItem, {
    'Director Approval Status': {Value: "Approved"},
    'Director Approved By': User(),
    'Director Approval Date': Now(),
    Status: {Value: "Director Approved"}
});

// Add approval comment
Patch(Comments, Defaults(Comments), {
    Request: ThisItem,
    'Comment Text': "APPROVED: " & director_comments,
    'Comment Type': {Value: "Director Decision"}
});
```

### Form Validation & User Experience
- ✅ Required field validation
- ✅ Success/error notifications
- ✅ Form reset after submission
- ✅ Conditional field visibility (justification for high-cost)
- ✅ Role-based screen navigation
- ✅ Intuitive button placement and colors

## Testing Results

### Functionality Tests ✅
1. **Staff submission**: Regular and high-cost requests properly flagged
2. **Department queue**: Filtering and assignment working correctly
3. **Director approval**: Approve/reject actions update status properly
4. **Admin overview**: KPIs calculate correctly
5. **Role detection**: Users see appropriate screens

### Director Approval Workflow Tests ✅
1. **$6,000 request** → Auto-flagged → Appears in director screen
2. **Critical priority** → Auto-flagged → Director notification needed
3. **Clinical Support category** → Auto-flagged → Requires approval
4. **Director approve** → Status changes → Available to department
5. **Director reject** → Request closed → Requester notified

### User Experience Tests ✅
1. **Mobile responsive**: Works on phone and tablet
2. **Navigation intuitive**: Users find appropriate functions easily
3. **Error handling**: Clear messages for validation failures
4. **Performance**: Fast loading and responsive interactions
